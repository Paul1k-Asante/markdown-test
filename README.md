#  Mark down is a language that is used to write webpages
and normally when write a webpage we used the HTML; 
But HTML can be syntax heavy and alot of time it's not really
convenient to write a Blog post OR an Article on a web page inside
of HTML and that is where markdown becomes useful.

NOTE : mark down allows as to write basic webpages using plain text
and it will get rendered by what's called a markdown engine 
(Convert The Plain Text Into HTML)

# NOTE : In This Tutorials We Will Look At The Mark Down Syntax

Markdown file are created with the extension {.md }
The number of # correspond to the Size
# Header 1

##### Header 5

The horizontal rule is basicall just a horizontal line 
that goes across our website that separates content
